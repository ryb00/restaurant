## Navigation bar

The fully responsive navigation bar featured on all pages includes links to the Page Logo, Home Page, Chefs Page, Gallery and Contact us and is identical on each for easy navigation.

Next, for devices with a width greater than 768px, there are two columns (for devices with a width up to 768px, the first column is missing).

The first column contains images of dishes, which allows a potential client to form an impression of the restaurant menu.
